This is a project i have set as a challenge for myself. The intention was to create something that would require me to learn hwo to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript independently without a reliance of following an online tutorial.

The project has taught me several important things about programming and web design, the first and most important being organisation of my code. The Script and CSS for this project is retrospectively a mess, had I understood
more about programming there are many things I would change about my inital approaches. The scope of this project was much further than I had realised or intended but being overly perfectionist has left mr forcing myself
to add additional features to the app beyond my first intentions.

The Initial idea for this project was to create an app with which someone could make a fully customisable deck of playing cards. I hadb't been able to find a card designing app online that would allow for each individual 
suit icon to be replaced with an image. This inspired me to use this as a learning project in the hopes of creating a user friendly website design that would allow the user to view and download an easily customisable deck 
with only trhe click of a few buttons.
